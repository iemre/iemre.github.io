      Product Review: Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been pondering whether or not a standing desk would add value to my work flow and life. And I finally got the <a href="https://www.fully.com/en-eu/standing-desks/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html">Jarvis Standing Desk</a> for a couple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is probably a good investment now with the coronavirus pandemic and the advent of remote work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I find that I need to stretch and move my body quite frequently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many times during the day, I find that I need to do something quick on my computer and I feel like having to sit down for that is slow and inefficient.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here a picture:</p>

<p>I went with the <code>120cm x 80cm</code> option. The depth (80cm) of the desk is enough for my 31-inch display monitor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all automatic. I touch the button on the side of the desk to make it go up and down. I thought about getting the manual one with a crank but I&rsquo;m glad I got the automatic one, because I adjust the desk height quite often.</p>
<p>After an hour or so of standing, I feel like sitting down for a half hour. Whether or not I work sitting down or standing up also depends on the activity I&rsquo;m involved in: if I&rsquo;m actively thinking about a problem or writing an exciting piece of code, I will probably do so while standing. The same applies if I am in a remote meeting that requires my full and undivided attention. I turn my camera off in those meetings, because I move quite a lot when I&rsquo;m standing which may be distracting to other people.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m quite happy with the desk. It&rsquo;s well-designed and built, and it adds value to my daily routine. It is slightly on the expensive side but its price is comparable to other products in the market.</p>
