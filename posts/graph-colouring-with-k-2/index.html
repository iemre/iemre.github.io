<h2 id="initial-thoughts-on-the-solution">Initial thoughts on the solution</h2>
<p>At a first glance, it sounds very similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring">the Graph Colouring problem</a>.
In fact I believe it is no different from it, although it is a special case of the graph colouring problem with 2 as the number of colours.</p>
<p>My solution to the problem:</p>
<pre><code>rivals = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]

matches = [(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B), (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;)]

def solve():
  labels = {}  # e.g. { &quot;A&quot;: &quot;good&quot;, &quot;B&quot;: &quot;bad&quot; ... }
  
  # key is a rival, and value is a set of other rivals the key rival 
  # has a match with. E.g. { &quot;A&quot;: {&quot;B&quot;}, &quot;B&quot;: {&quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;}, &quot;C&quot;: {&quot;B&quot;} }
  graph = {}  

  # construct the graph
  for match in matches:
    if match[0] not in graph:
      match[0] = set()
    if match[1] not in graph:
      match[1] = set()

    match[0].add(match[1])
    match[1].add(match[0])

  
  for match in matches:
    # the _label function is going to have a recursive ripple effect
    # and solve the problem recursively
    # but it is still necessary to iterate through all matches and call _label
    # because if the graph is disconnected, 
    # calling _label on only one match would only process 1 subgraph.
    # example: matches=[(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;), (&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X)] 
    # where we have two separate subgraphs

    arbitrary_label = &quot;good&quot;
    _label(match[0], arbitrary_label, graph, labels)

  return labels


def _label(current_rival, label, graph, labels):
  if current_rival in labels:
    # already processed and labeled
    return

  new_label = &quot;bad&quot;
  if label == &quot;bad&quot;:
    new_label = &quot;good&quot;
  
  labels[current_rival] = label
  matching_rivals = graph[current_rival]
  
  for matching_rival in matching_rivals:
    labels[matching_rival] = new_label 
    _label(matching_rival, new_label, graph, labels)

</code></pre><p>I haven&rsquo;t thought about how to solve the problem where the number of colours/labels <code>k &gt; 2</code>.
I could always rely on backtracking, and build a tree of the whole candidate solution space. However even if I have the
candidate solution space, I&rsquo;d need to check if a candidate solution is a valid one, which is a challenging problem on its own.
The fact that the number of colours here is 2 makes the solution much easier, as the general solution to the graph colouring problem appears to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness">NP-complete</a>.</p>
