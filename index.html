    This post describes my current &ldquo;work from iPad&rdquo; set-up. There are a few good reasons for doing this:
Battery. This is a big reason for me to take the iPad with me on the go instead of a laptop. Its battery lasts days. Portability. The iPad is smaller and lighter than most laptops. And I can use it as an e-reader on public transport. Drawing with the Apple pen Hardware The 2018 iPad Pro with 11&rsquo;&rsquo; display, 64GB storage - https://support.

    You&rsquo;re given an array of rivals:
rivals = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]
And a list of matches between two rivals represented in tuple form:
matches = [(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B), (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;)]
Assign a label (either &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo;) to each rival, so that there is no match where both rivals have the same label.
Initial thoughts on the solution At a first glance, it sounds very similar to the Graph Colouring problem. In fact I believe it is no different from it, although it is a special case of the graph colouring problem with 2 as the number of colours.

    I&rsquo;ve been pondering whether or not a standing desk would add value to my work flow and life. And I finally got the Jarvis Standing Desk for a couple reasons:
It is probably a good investment now with the coronavirus pandemic and the advent of remote work.
I find that I need to stretch and move my body quite frequently.
Many times during the day, I find that I need to do something quick on my computer and I feel like having to sit down for that is slow and inefficient.
